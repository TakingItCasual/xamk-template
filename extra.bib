    abstract = {This survey paper presents a classification of different challenges and tracking techniques in the field of augmented reality. The challenges in augmented reality are categorized into performance challenges, alignment challenges, interaction challenges, mobility/portability challenges and visualization challenges. Augmented reality tracking techniques are mainly divided into sensor-based tracking, vision-based tracking and hybrid tracking. The sensor-based tracking is further divided into optical tracking, magnetic tracking, acoustic tracking, inertial tracking or any combination of these to form hybrid sensors tracking. Similarly, the vision-based tracking is divided into marker-based tracking and markerless tracking. Each tracking technique has its advantages and limitations. Hybrid tracking provides a robust and accurate tracking but it involves financial and technical difficulties.},
